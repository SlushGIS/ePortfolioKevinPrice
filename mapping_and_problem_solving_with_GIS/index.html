    <a id="siteSelection">
    <p>The following report was created as part of a course lesson in which we performed a hypothetical site selection scenario with tailored data for the purpose of helping a client 
        establishing a vineyard. The analysis steps for this lesson were predetermined and served as walk through process for conducting such an analysis. However, I additionally
        included existing vineyard sites in the area from a publicly availble source. This was not a part of the assignment but demonstrates my knowledge of and ability to find and utilizes
        publicly available data. It also serves as an important acknowledgment that no analysis is perfect and additional information or different ways of interpreting information can drastically 
        change the results of an analysis.</p>

    <a id="analysisWalkthrough">
    <p>The following report is an example of a geoanalysis that was put together by myself from start to finish. The lesson provided criteria and data but required the analysis steps 
        to be determined by the individual with justification for their choices. Ulitmately there was an expected outcome but there were many ways to achieve that result. The workflow 
        document created for this project can be downloaded at the link below.
